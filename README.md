# OpenWithMPV.app
## OSX wrapper app bundle for [mpv](https://mpv.io/): 
Spawns a new mpv.app instance for each run (file open). Multiple selections are opened as a playlist.

I was used to one-window for one-file-open approach, which is default in Windows and Ubuntu, so I tried to do the same in Mac systems using wrapper apps. Similar steps can be applied to other kinds of apps, like VLC and others...

### Requirements:
* [mpv](https://mpv.io/).app bundle should be installed and run at least once beforehand.

### Installation:

* 1. [Download](https://github.com/basakil/OpenWithMPV.app/releases) and install OpenWithMPV.app as an application. 
* 2. Run the app (OpenWithMPV.app) once (to get it in the *'get info'* and _'open with'_ menus).
* 3. [Associate](https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=osx+file+type+associations) any file type you wanted to be opened with the app.
